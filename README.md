## Description

This document summarises the initial methodology used in creating an open data community resilience index. We wanted to investigate community resilience with open data to help Leeds city council develop their research around Social Isolation and Community Resilience. The following details in this readme outline the methodology and preliminary results. 

##TODO

- Add optimisation
- Add alternate assignment algothrithms
	- Assign with smallest area first
	- Split space and assign based on sub-groups
	- Use graph based approach?
